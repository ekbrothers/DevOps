One of the primary cultural shifts required for adopting DevOps practices is at the backlog level. The novel The Phoenix Project designates the following types of work:

* **Business projects.** Work that comes from business initiatives.

* **Internal IT or engineering projects.** Infrastructure/operations projects from a business project, or internal improvement projects. These items should be tracked in the same backlog.

To continuously improve the system of work and adaptability, it is recommended that at least 20% of development and operations teams' time is allocated toward nonfunctional requirements such as security and infrastructure, among others, to make the process significantly better and more stable. If time is not allocated to this work, technical debt will accumulate and create more unplanned work.

**Unplanned/recovery work.** Operational incidents tacked onto planned work, which might cause bottlenecks and confusion with handoffs. This work can also cause long lead times with high utilization, and it is often the result of not removing technical debt or improving practices.
Lead time is the cycle time from when a team starts writing code to its first successful deployment in the production environment. 

**Lead time** is considered a measurable metric that could be improved with DevOps practices.
