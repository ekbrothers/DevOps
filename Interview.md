* know how to deliver incrementally, 
* focus on value delivery
* working cross-team you should be solid.
* define the what and how based on their expertise and ability to see a problem and figure out a way forward

Data ingestion 
* process by which data is moved from one or more sources to a destination where it can be stored and further analyzed

* might be in different formats and come from various sources, including RDBMS, other types of databases, S3 buckets, CSVs, or from streams.

* it needs to be cleansed and transformed in a way that allows you to analyze it together with data from other sources.

* can ingest data in real time, in batches, or in a combination of the two (this is called lambda architecture). When you ingest data in batches, data is imported at regularly scheduled intervals.

* data unit testing

**QA in DevOps**
* Requirements need to be specific. QA teams should proactively involve in the requirements process to help and guide development teams towards proper direction.  
*QA & testing has to move towards leveraging automation tools to automate testing wherever possible. 
* Development, operations, and QA teams should be facilitated and encouraged to communicate, collaborate, and optimize their efforts. 
* Continuous integration is the key to identifying defects early in the development lifecycle. For continuous integration to be implemented effectively, all the stakeholders have to integrate their work often on a day-to-day basis. 
* A fully automated continuous testing process needs to be integrated into the SDLC for a successful continuous delivery process that minimizes risks, reduces costs, and accelerates time to market by frequent releases
