A **Package Management System** or **Package Manager** is a set of tools that allows you to form complete packages that are ready to be pushed to release and deployment management. It automates the process of installing, upgrading, downgrading, configuring, removing, and purging software. A package manager, sometimes called a package repository, maintains a database of the key application metadata, such as:

* The name
* The description
* The maintainer
* The dependencies
* Version information

In a DevOps environment, the package manager has an important role in the DevOps toolchains because it creates a bridge between the build and the release phases. It doesn't only include software-related packages but also packages of the infrastructure builds; this increases automation and implements DevOps best practices.
